* 0.1.1.2 (2014-06-07)
  - Added preliminary support for VTK output in ascii polydata format.
    Input is suitable for use (and has been used) with ParaView. XTK's parser
	 seems to be incomplete at the moment, unfortunately. Otherwise
	 visualizations could happen via WebGL.
  - Messed around with INLINE and -funbox-strict-fields a bit; no benefit
    realized.
