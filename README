# directed-cubical
## by Michael Misamore, Feb 2014

This package provides a library of functions for creating and manipulating
finite directed cubical complexes, together with a module containing algorithms
implementing the corner reduction techniques discovered by the author for
simplifying these complexes. Further enhancements will be added as time permits.
The underlying theory is described in the author's research article "Computing
Path Categories of Finite Directed Cubical Complexes". 

Some examples are available under the "Examples" directory. To use them, unpack
the tarball for this package into some directory, cd into directed-cubical-0.1.0.0, 
and run "cabal install" (assuming the Haskell Platform has been installed already). 
That should compile and install the modules on your system as well as build some
library documentation (in the "dist" directory).  If all works okay so far, you
should be able to change to the "Examples" directory and compile them with lines
like

ghc -O2 swissFlag.hs -threaded

which should give an optimized, threaded program that runs the corner reduction
algorithm against the famous "swiss flag" example. Multiple threads work like
this:

./swissFlag +RTS -N4

where 4 is the number of cores in this example.
